Major features of a wireless network:
Frequency
Range
Data rate
# of users
# of channels
Privacy

Things that affect the network:
Radio power output (network independent)
Radio sensitivity (dependent on modulation/data rate/frequency/hardware/etc.)
Tx/Rx Antenna gains (frequency dependent)
Environment for network (noise level, trees, buildings etc.)
Type of information being communicated
Level of expertise
Expectations for the network (size, coverage, robustness)
